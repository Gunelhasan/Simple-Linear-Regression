I built a Simple Linear Regression model to analyze the linear relationship between experience years and salary. This approach aimed to understand how changes in years of experience could predict variations in salary, allowing us to quantify this relationship. 
The process involved data preprocessing, visualization, and regression model implementation, with a focus on understanding the model's predictive power and evaluating its assumptions.
